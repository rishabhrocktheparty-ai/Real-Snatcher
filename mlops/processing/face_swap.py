# face_swap.py
# Face Swap API Client Module
# Mandate: Use commercial, production-grade APIs for high consistency and low latency.
# API COST WARNING: Purchase of credits/API keys required. Industry price benchmark: ~$0.02 - $0.03 per second of input video for reliable, high-res results.
# Internal GPU training for deepfakes is prohibitively complex for consumer apps.
